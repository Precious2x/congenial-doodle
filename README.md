<p> <strong>Everyone needs to see this message!</strong> Welcome to my first assignment, I took so much to learn this by myself since <em>no one was avaliable to help me</em> and considering the fact that I also don't like asking for help, however I think I got the hang off it and I'm prouf of myself.Anyways this is a random paragraph I found.Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as <q>a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit.</q>  </p>
<p>Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous, they are, <em>except in two main situations</em>, entirely harmless. Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants. When confronted with humans, piranhas instinct is to flee, not attack. But there are two situations in which a piranha bite is likely.A topic sentence is a precise statement that reflects the main idea of the paragraph. It should be carefully written as it will show the reader what you are going to talk about. Words chosen for this should not be cluttered and ambiguous as readers will decide to read further based on this. It is not necessary to write the topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph. It can be put anywhere, as long as it reflects the<strong> main </strong> topic. For instance, if you mention that you are going to talk about the advantages of using the hand sanitizer, then in supporting sentence you should only talk about advantages, not the features or anything else. </p>
